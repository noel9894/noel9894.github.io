						<i style="color:rgb(54, 197, 54);">“It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped…“</i>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						It’s not mine of course, I just came across this on the net. Seems true, right? The decisions that we make are who we are now. Let me give you a glimpse into the life that I seek ahead.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						I really like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Services_of_India" title="Indian Civil Service">Civil Services</a>, and I wish to pursue it as my career. See, I was brought up in the principle that respect and satisfaction are greater than money, and of course it’s true. To be able to serve the people as someone they love and respect, as one among them, I would really love that. Unfortunately for me the present scenario in India is not so encouraging for anyone to pursue this mesmerizing profession. Politics seems to be blinding the people, often making them act without thinking about the morality of whatever it is they are doing. I was shocked about what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raju_Narayana_Swamy" title="Raju Narayana Swami">Mr. Raju Narayana Swami</a> had to face after the incidents of the <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/munnar-eviction-drive-again-uphill-task-for-vs/571961" title="Munnar Issue- IndianExpress">Munnar Issue</a> in Kerala. 
					</p>
					<p class="plans">
						Well ‘No pain, no gain’, isn’t it? I think I will take that risk.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						I just really want to be happy and satisfied, not rich and famous. So my plans don’t span too much time ahead. I believe in short to average term goals, long term goals will come along later, I guess.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						I just like to live my life with confidence. I’ve heard of a quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan" title="William Jennings Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						<i style="color:white;"> “Destiny is not a matter of chance, it’s a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.”</i>.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						 Man I still get goosebumps when I read that!
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="plans">
						Well that's all about my plans for now. i'll keep you posted about new ones...
