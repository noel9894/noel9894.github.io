						I was born to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paulcm3001?fref=ts" title="FB profile- Paul C M">Paul C M</a> , a physics professor and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/soly.paul?fref=ts" title="FB profile- Soly Paul">Soly Paul</a>, a homeopathic physician on 9th August, 1994. I’ve heard that I was too active for my age. Well I can’t really blame myself; if not then, when?
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="childhood">
						I think I was a quick learner (everything was new and it all caught my eye apparently). Being the only child of my parents, I had 3 younger cousins to keep me company 24x7. I remember making all sorts of herbal medicines and “death-preventives” (from flowers that my mother so passionately grew) for the poor ants in my courtyard.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="childhood">
						I was very picky about what I ate, the toys that I got, and of course the dresses that I wore (most of the time I felt awkward in shiny little shirts, and colourful trousers). My childhood was what I would like to call <i title="Just Incredible">“semplicemente incredibile”</i>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="childhood">
						I studied in <a href="http://mcleodschoolwayanad.com/" title="McLeod's English School">The McLeod’s English School, Poomala</a> for nine years, right from playschool to 6th Std. I really can’t imagine where I would be without that school, the teachers, the way of teaching, every single thing was perfect in that school.  Although we had low student strength, this actually helped the teachers to pay individual attention to the students. Sadly it was not affiliated to the CBSE board then, so my parents decided to take me to a new school where I would find more opportunities and a higher competitive level. That’s how reached <a href="http://greenhillssby.com/" title="The Greenhills Public School">The Greenhills Public School, Sulthan Bathery</a>.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="childhood">
						<a href="http://greenhillssby.com/" title="The Greenhills Public School">The Greenhills Public School</a>, when I first saw it, was a new school in my district and was growing fast, competing with the leading schools in <a href="http://www.wayanad.com/" title="My district">Wayanad</a>. It was there I realised my potential. I was presented with the opportunity to participate in many competitions (school, district, state and national level). I believe I used those well and performed well. Most important of all, I became an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Talent_Search_Examination" title="National Talent Search Examination">NTSE</a> scholar in 8th Std. (Later I came to know it’s called the ‘Student IAS’). Two years later I passed my class X exam in flying colours.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="childhood">
						After 10th, I enrolled in a residential entrance coaching programme, organised by <a href="http://www.brilliant-tutorials.com/" title="The site is dead">The Brilliant Tutorials, Chennai</a>, near our school, while continuing in XI in <abbr title="The Greenhills Public School">GHPS</abbr>. It was the first of its kind in our locality. Unfortunately, the MD of Brilliant Tutorials passed away soon after the programme started, and the North Indian Chapter was sold to <a href="http://www.careerlauncher.com/" title="Career Launcher">Career Launcher</a>. Keeping in mind the promise they made to the many students who registered for the course, the Kerala Chapter became independent and continued the programme. Even amidst this turmoil they kept up the quality of coaching. After two years of hard work, I cleared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Joint_Entrance_Examination" title="The Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examnation">IIT-JEE</a> with an <abbr title="All India Rank">AIR</abbr> of 2427 and chose Civil Engineering in <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" title="IIT Kharagpur">IIT Kharagpur</a>. Well hose two years were really memorable. Friends, hostel-life, school… Everything was awesome.

					<p class="childhood">
						And IIT KGP is where I am right now…
