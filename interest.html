						My interests have always displayed a dynamic nature ever since I was a kid. So I’m not what to put in here. Well what say we talk about my present interests, huh?
						<ul id="int">
							<li>
								<b class="int">Computers</b> 
									<p class="interest">
								 		It has always been computers. These things practically amaze me. Although I have been using a system since I was 3 years old. I love fixing the issues that pop up while using the system; don’t misunderstand me for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging" title="Debugging">debugging</a> codes for I am not much of a coder. I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting" title="Troubleshooting">‘trouble-shooter’</a> (I am not sure whether that word exists). Whatever the matter, if it’s even slightly related to computers, I seem to understand them more. 
								 	</p>
								 	<br/>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b class="int">Games</b>
									<p class="interest">
										I also have a passion for games. Generally I prefer the action packed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_and_slash" title="Hack and Slash">H&S</a> sort of thing, but I may also go for sports-based high-end games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)" title="FIFA game series">FIFA</a>. Not a big fan of multiplayer gaming. My problem with these hypnotising hobbies is that I often lack the determination to stop playing. I tend to play for long hours in a single go, finishing of large games in short time. Don’t get me wrong, I am proud that I am a gamer, but I just wish I could enjoy them more.
									</p>
									<br/>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b class="int">Football</b>
									<p class="interest">
										I just love football. Before I got ‘seriously’ involved in acads I used to follow the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html" title="Barclay's Premiere League">Barclays</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga" title="Spanish Premiere League">Spanish</a> premiere leagues well. Now I am just content to playing the sport real-time. When I play I just give my total dedication to the game (It has gifted me generously with a lot of dislocated ankles and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury" title="Ligament tear">torn ligaments</a>, luckily not a fracture till date). I fell the spirit of sports and competition all through those ninety minutes. I’d love to play again but a ligament tear in my ankle has put me on the benches.
